[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. hopefully this description has been modified. will this change work again?

This will be a simple application where anyone who has accses to it can play a simple game of Connect 4 anywhere they want. They can either play with themselves against a computer that will randomly place down their dots or against a friend in person with each person taking turns. You can either play as a guest or log in with your information to keep track of you and your friends' scores as well.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.
